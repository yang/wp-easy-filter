Overview
--------

This is a simple, general filter plug-in for WordPress.  You specify a mapping
from tags to commands, such as:

  $tag2cmd = array('pandoc' => '/usr/bin/pandoc -s --tab-stop=2');

Then, for posts which are prefixed with a shebang line containing that tag, as in:

  #!pandoc

  Hello, world.

Then the plug-in will feed the post contents to that command's stdin and return
the rendered output to WordPress for display.

This plug-in was designed to allow me to start using [Pandoc] for writing my
blog posts.  (I couldn't force myself to use the [PHP Markdown Extras]
plug-in.)

It disables the `wpautop` filter, which automatically inserts `<p>` tags (among
other magic), because that filter cannot properly parse the style of HTML that
Pandoc outputs.

Setup
-----

Drop `easyfilt.php` into your `wp-content/plugins/` directory, then activate
the plug-in from the admin interface.

Notes
-----

The author of [PHP Markdown Extras] wrote an [informative blog post] describing
problems he had getting his filter to work properly and co-exist with the other
built-in filters.
